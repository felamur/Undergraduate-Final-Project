In this project PC and Raspberry Pi connected to same network via Wi-Fi to communicate with each other. Raspberry Pi application uses Raspberry Camera to recognize objects and it frequently communicates with Arduino since it handles navigation with the help of ultrasonic distance sensor. After robot car achieves its goal, Raspberry Pi uses camera to send found objects photo to PC and causing PC to make a sound, indicating correct object is found.
